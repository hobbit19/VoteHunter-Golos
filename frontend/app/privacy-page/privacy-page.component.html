		<h3 class="h3">Ads and Analytics Partners</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">16. We may partner with third-party advertisers, ad networks, and analytics providers to deliver advertising and
		content targeted to your interests and to better understand your use of the Services. These third parties may
		collect information sent by your computer, browser, or mobile device in response to a request for content, such
		as unique identifiers, your IP address, or other information about your computer or device. For example:</p>
		<h4 class="h4">Advertisers and Ad Networks</h4>
		<p class="paragraph">17. Our ad partners and network may use cookies and use related technologies to collect
			information when ads are delivered to you on our Services, but YouSource does not link to or provide your
			actual YouSource account details to these advertising partners. This means that YouSource does not share your
			individual account browsing habits with advertisers. YouSource cannot see advertisers’ cookies and advertisers
			will not see YouSource cookies.</p>
		<h4 class="h4">Analytics Partners</h4>
		<p class="paragraph">18. We use analytics partners (such as Google Analytics) to help analyze usage and traffic
			for our Services. As an example, we may use analytics partners to analyze and measure, in the aggregate, the
			number of unique visitors to our Services.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">19. For more information about how you may control the collection and/or use of information
			for advertising and analytics purposes, please see “Your Choices.”</p>
		<h3 class="h3">Security</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">20. We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft,
			misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
		<h3 class="h3">Children under 13</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">21. Although we welcome users from all walks of life, YouSource is not intended or directed
			at individuals under the age of 13. Therefore, individuals under the age of 13 may not create an account or
			otherwise access or use the Services.</p>
		<h3 class="h3">Your Choices</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">22. As a YouSource user, you have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use,
			and disclosure of, information about you. This includes:</p>
		<h4 class="h4">Preferences</h4>
		<p class="paragraph">23. We may provide you with tools and preference settings that allow you to access,
			correct, delete, and modify information associated with your account.</p>
		<h4 class="h4">Account Information</h4>
		<p class="paragraph">24. You may delete your account information at any time by logging into your account and
			following the steps under “Preferences.” When you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to
			other users and disassociated from content you posted under that account. Please note, however, that the
			posts, comments, and messages you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others,
			unless you delete such content. We may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for
			legitimate business purposes after you delete your account. Any information that has been published to the
			YouSource blockchain will also remain indefinitely.</p>
		<h4 class="h4">Cookies</h4>
		<p class="paragraph">25. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually
			choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. Please note that if you
			choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our
			Services.</p>
		<h4 class="h4">Third-Party Advertising and Analytics</h4>
		<p class="paragraph">26. Some analytics providers may provide specific opt-out mechanisms (e.g. Google Analytics
			Opt-out), and we will provide, as needed, additional tools and third-party services that allow you to better
			understand cookies and how you can opt-out. You have the ability to opt out of having your web browsing
			information used for behavioral advertising purposes. For more information about behavioral advertising, or
			to opt out, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices.</p>
		<h4 class="h4">Do Not Track</h4>
		<p class="paragraph">27. Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in most web browsers. We
			support DNT in our Services. There is no accepted standard on how to respond to web browsers’ DNT signals.
			When you have DNT enabled, we may still use information collected for analytics and measurement purposes or
			to otherwise provide our Services (e.g., YouSource.com buttons), but we will not load any third-party
			trackers. You may, however, opt out of having information about you collected and used for behavioral
			advertising purposes, as described above.</p>
		<h4 class="h4">Promotional Communications</h4>
		<p class="paragraph">28. You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by following the
			instructions in those communications. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications,
			such as information about your account or your use of our Services.</p>
		<h4 class="h4">Mobile Notifications</h4>
		<p class="paragraph">29. With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or
			alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification
			settings on your mobile device.</p>
		<h3 class="h3">International Data Transfers</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">30. We are based in the United States and the information we collect is governed by U.S.
			law. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the
			processing, transfer and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, where you may not
			have the same rights as you do under local law.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">31. YouSource complies with the U.S.-E.U. and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of
			notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. Despite an adverse
			judgment by the European Court of Justice on October 6, 2015, the U.S. Department of Commerce has advised
			that it continues to administer the Safe Harbor program until further notice. To learn more about the Safe
			Harbor program, and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce website. If you
			have concerns about our compliance with the Safe Harbor program, you should contact us. If you are unable to
			resolve your concern or dispute with us, you may submit complaints to JAMS for mediation pursuant to the
			JAMS International Mediation Rules.</p>
		<h3 class="h3">Changes</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">32. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will let you know by
			revising the date at the top of the policy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion,
			is material, we will provide you with additional notice. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy
			whenever you access or use our Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information
			practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. If you continue to use our Services after Privacy
			Policy changes go into effect, you consent to the revised policy.</p>
